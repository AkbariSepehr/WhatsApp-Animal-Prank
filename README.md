# WhatsApp-Animal-Prank

Have you ever wanted to enoy people on whatsapp? I'm sure you have. 

With this program you can very much easily do so.

This program will message your chosen friend (victim) about "too many times" on whatsapp.
with the format [**friendsname** is a **animalname**]

NOTE:

In my program I've written the name as "Rayén". so easily delete that name, and put your own friends name's instead (unless their name is Rayén, which is weird)


To RUN:

 - install Python
 - pip install pyautogui 
 - pip install time (if you dont have it)
 - log into whatsapp web application 






ALSO: {very important}

I have not written the animal name generator program, but added it to the directory anyways.
its in Ruby, and pretty simple.
